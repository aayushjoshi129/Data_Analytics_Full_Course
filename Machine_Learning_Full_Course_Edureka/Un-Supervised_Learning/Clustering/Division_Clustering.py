# Division clustering, also known as divisive clustering, is a hierarchical clustering technique in machine learning. Unlike agglomerative clustering, which starts with individual data points and merges them into larger clusters, divisive clustering begins with one large cluster containing all data points and recursively divides it into smaller clusters. This process continues until each data point is in its own cluster or until a stopping criterion is met. Division clustering produces a hierarchical structure of clusters, similar to agglomerative clustering, but in reverse order.
