# Numpy is the short form of Numerical Python

# In 2005, Travis Oliphant created Numpy package

# Numpy is a package that defines a multi dimension array object and associates fast math and functions that operate on it.

# It also has functions for working in a domain of linear algebra, fourier transformations and matrices.

# In Simple Words, It is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python
