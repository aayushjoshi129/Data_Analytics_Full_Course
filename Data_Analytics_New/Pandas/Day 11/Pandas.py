# Pandas is a python package providing fast, flexible amd expressive datastructures designed to make working with 'relational' or 'labelled' data both easy and intuitive.

# Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:
# It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

# The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008


# Pandas Applications

# Easy handling of missing data
# Size Mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional data
# Automatic and explicit data alignment: Objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrames, etc.

# Automatically align the data for you in computations
# powerful, flexible group by functionality
# Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and sub-setting of larger data sets.
# Intuitive merging and joining datasets
# Flexible reshaping and pivoting of datasets.


# Data Structures
# The best way to think about the pandas data structure is as flexible containers for lower dimensional data.
# For Ex- Data Frame is a container for series, and series is a containers for scalars.
# we would like to be able to insert and remove objects form these containers in a dictionary-like fashion.

# Series in Pandas
# Pandas series is a 1-D Labelled array capable of holding data types of any type. The axis labels are collectively called index. Pandas series is nothing but a column in an excel sheet.

# The Object supports both integer and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index.



# DATA FRAMES
# Pandas DF is a 2D size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labelled axes (rows and columns). A DF is a 2D data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns. Pandas DF consist of 3 principal components i.e., the data, the rows and the columns.
