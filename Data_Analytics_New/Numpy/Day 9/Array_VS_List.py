# A list cannot directly handle Mathematical Operations, while Array can.

# An array consumes less memory than a list

# Using an Array is faster than the list

# A list can store different datatypes, while you can't do that in an Array


# A List is easier to modify since a list store each element individually, it is easier to add and delete an element than an array.

# In list, one can have nested data with different size, while you cannot do the same in Array.
